Java terms
Class- a class acts as a blueprint, we can use the “blueprint” to build many houses based on the plans.
Reference – using a house as an analogy, if you want to tell someone where you live you give them your address by texting or writing it down, you’re referencing.
references can be passed into parameters, constructors and methods.
example
class House {
private String color;
public House(String color) {
	this.color = color;
}
}
Both super and this can be used anywhere but static areas.
Super – is used to access/call the parent class members (variables and methods).
This – is used to call the current class members
This() – use this() to call ca constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class,
Should only be used in a constructor class and has to be first statement – check constructor file
Super() – this is to used to reference an outside file, or parent file.
Examples
class House {
private String color;
public House(String color) {
	this.color = color;
}
}
